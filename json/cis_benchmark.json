If a filesystem type is not needed it should be disabled. Native Linux file systems are designed to ensure that built-in security controls function as expected. Non-native filesystems can lead to unexpected consequences to both the security and functionality of the system and should be used with caution. Many filesystems are created for niche use cases and are not maintained and supported as the operating systems are updated and patched. Users of non-native filesystems should ensure that there is attention and ongoing support for them, especially in light of frequent operating system changes. Standard network connectivity and Internet access to cloud storage may make the use of non-standard filesystem formats to directly attach heterogeneous devices much less attractive",

This prevents the exploitation of vulnerabilities discovered at a later date. If a service is not enabled, it cannot be exploited. The actions in this section of the document provide guidance on some services which can be safely disabled and under which circumstances, greatly reducing the number of possible threats to the resulting system. Additionally, some services which should remain enabled but with secure configuration are covered as well as insecure service clients.",
