If a filesystem type is not needed it should be disabled. Native Linux file systems are designed to ensure that built-in security controls function as expected. Non-native filesystems can lead to unexpected consequences to both the security and functionality of the system and should be used with caution. Many filesystems are created for niche use cases and are not maintained and supported as the operating systems are updated and patched. Users of non-native filesystems should ensure that there is attention and ongoing support for them, espeCIAlly in light of frequent operating system changes. Standard network connectivity and Internet access to cloud storage may make the use of non-standard filesystem formats to directly attach heterogeneous devices much less attractive",

Packages providing PAM modules register their profiles at install time by calling pam-auth-update --package. Selection of profiles is done using the standard debconf interface. The profile selection question will be asked at medium priority when packages are added or removed, so no user interaction is required by default. Users may invoke pam-auth-update directly to change their authentication configuration. The pam-auth-update script makes every effort to respect local changes to /etc/pam.d/common-*. Local modifications to the list of module options will be preserved, and additions of modules within the managed portion of the stack will cause pam-auth-update to treat the config files as locally modified and not make further changes to the config files unless given the --force option. If the user specifies that pam-auth-update should override local configuration changes, the locally-modified files will be saved in /etc/pam.d/ with a suffix of .pam-old.",

In the case of the latter, it may offer advice to the user on changing their password or, through the PAM_AUTHTOKEN_REQD return, delay giving service to the user until they have established a new password. The entries listed above are documented in the shadow(5) manual page. Should the user's record not contain one or more of these entries, the corresponding shadow check is not performed. The authentication component performs the task of checking the users credentials (password).

                "Description": "`pam_faillock.so` is a PAM module used to manage account lockouts after multiple failed authentication attempts. It helps protect against brute-force attacks by tracking failed logins and locking user accounts when thresholds are exceeded. By default, it stores failure records in `/var/run/faillock`, though this directory is usually cleared on reboot. To retain failure records across reboots, a different directory should be specified using the `dir=` option. The `audit` option logs failed attempts when the user isn't found, while `silent` suppresses user-facing messages. If `no_log_info` is set, the system won’t log informational messages via syslog. The `local_users_only` option ensures only users listed in `/etc/passwd` are tracked, ignoring centralized accounts (like LDAP or AD), and avoids double-lockouts. With `nodelay`, the system won’t impose a delay after failed logins. The `deny=n` option sets how many consecutive failures are allowed before locking the account, with the default being 3. The `fail_interval=n` specifies how many seconds those failures must occur within (default: 900 seconds or 15 minutes). The `unlock_time=n` option determines how long the account remains locked (default: 600 seconds or 10 minutes), with `0` meaning it stays locked until manually reset with the `faillock` command. If `even_deny_root` is set, the root account can also be locked, and `root_unlock_time=n` controls how long root stays locked. If not specified, it defaults to the `unlock_time`. The `admin_group=name` option applies root-like lockout behavior to members of the specified group.",

It is recommended that rsyslog be used for logging (with logwatch providing summarization) and auditd be used for auditing (with aureport providing summarization) to automatically monitor logs for intrusion attempts and other suspicious system behavior. In addition to the local log files created by the steps in this section, it is also recommended that sites collect copies of their system logs on a secure, centralized log server via an encrypted connection. Not only does centralized logging help sites correlate events that may be occurring on multiple systems, but having a second copy of the system log information may be critical after a system compromise where the attacker has modified the local log files on the affected system(s). If a log correlation system is deployed, configure it to process the logs described in this section. Because it is often necessary to correlate log information from many different systems (particularly after a security incident) it is recommended that the time be synchronized among systems and devices connected to the local network. The standard Internet protocol for time synchronization is the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which is supported by most network-ready devices. Reference <http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/> manual page for more information on configuring chrony. It is important that all logs described in this section be monitored on a regular basis and correlated to determine trends. A seemingly innocuous entry in one log could be more significant when compared to an entry in another log.",
